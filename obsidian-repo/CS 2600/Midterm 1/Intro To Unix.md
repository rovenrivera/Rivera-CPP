Started in the 1970s
- Originally coded in assembly on a PDP-7
- Rewritten in C to make it *[^1]portable*
- Was later morphed into [^2]BSD v1.0

Into the 1980s:
- Microsoft attempted to compete with *Xenix*
- AT&T attempted to compete with *System III*, which later transformed into the officially supported *System V*
- Sun Microsystems attempts to compete with SunOS
- HP attempts to compete with HP-UX
- DEC attempts to compete with Ultrix-11
- In order to deal with all the variance due to companies trying to compete, IEEE published [^3]*POSIX.1*

Into the 1990s:
- Sun Microsystems drops *SunOS* and switches to Solaris, continuing to make it compatible with their hardware only
- *Linux 1.0* is released, ported to DEC and Sun hardware

Into the 2000s:
- Since Linux was ported over to Sun hardware, Sun Microsystems struggled to stay in the market, so they released *OpenSolaris* to compete w/ Linux and keep people using Sun hardware
- *Mac OS X* gets certified
- Dell beings shipping computers with *Ubuntu*

Into the 2010s:
- Oracle buys Sun Microsystems, big reason why was because Sun Microsystems initially released Java and Oracle wanted to control the Java market
- Microsoft adds Linux subsystem to Windows 10
- Linux exceeds all other Unixes

Into the 2020s:
- Microsoft adds Recall -> makes a lot of people switch over to Linux
